Developer documentation
=======================

This chapter is only relevant if you'd like to contribute to the project. If you
only intend to use it, you can **safely skip this chapter**. This chapter explains
to the (future) developer why things are the way they are.

If you just want to extend enSHure and create a new module, you should only be
reading :doc:`how to write modules <writing_modules>`.
